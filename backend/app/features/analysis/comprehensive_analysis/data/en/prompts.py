openness_explanations = """
`Open people are intellectually curious,
appreciative of art, and sensitive to beauty. They tend to be,
compared to closed people, more aware of their feelings. They tend to
think and act in individualistic and nonconforming
ways. Intellectuals typically score high on Openness to Experience;
consequently, this factor has also been called Culture or
Intellect. <br /><br />Nonetheless, Intellect is probably best regarded as one aspect of openness
to experience. Scores on Openness to Experience are only modestly
related to years of education and scores on standard intelligent tests.
<br /><br />
Another characteristic of the open cognitive style is a facility for thinking
in symbols and abstractions far removed from concrete experience. Depending on
the individual's specific intellectual abilities, this symbolic cognition may
take the form of mathematical, logical, or geometric thinking, artistic and
metaphorical use of language, music composition or performance, or one of the
many visual or performing arts.
<br /><br />
People with low scores on openness to experience tend to have narrow, common
interests. They prefer the plain, straightforward, and obvious over the
complex, ambiguous, and subtle. They may regard the arts and sciences with
suspicion, regarding these endeavors as abstruse or of no practical use.
Closed people prefer familiarity over novelty; they are conservative and
resistant to change.
<br /><br />
Openness is often presented as healthier or more mature by psychologists, who
are often themselves open to experience. However, open and closed styles of
thinking are useful in different environments. The intellectual style of the
open person may serve a professor well, but research has shown that closed
thinking is related to superior job performance in police work, sales, and
a number of service occupations.`,

conscientiousness_summary = "Conscientiousness concerns the way in which we control, regulate, and direct our impulses."
conscientiousness_explanations = """
`Impulses are not inherently bad;
occasionally time constraints require a snap decision, and acting on
our first impulse can be an effective response. Also, in times of
play rather than work, acting spontaneously and impulsively can be
fun. Impulsive individuals can be seen by others as colorful,
fun-to-be-with, and zany.
<br /><br />
Nonetheless, acting on impulse can lead to trouble in a number of
ways. Some impulses are antisocial. Uncontrolled antisocial acts
not only harm other members of society, but also can result in
retribution toward the perpetrator of such impulsive acts. Another
problem with impulsive acts is that they often produce immediate
rewards but undesirable, long-term consequences. Examples include
excessive socializing that leads to being fired from one's job,
hurling an insult that causes the breakup of an important
relationship, or using pleasure-inducing drugs that eventually
destroy one's health.
<br /><br />
Impulsive behavior, even when not seriously destructive, diminishes
a person's effectiveness in significant ways. Acting impulsively
disallows contemplating alternative courses of action, some of which
would have been wiser than the impulsive choice. Impulsivity also
sidetracks people during projects that require organized sequences
of steps or stages. Accomplishments of an impulsive person are
therefore small, scattered, and inconsistent.
<br /><br />
A hallmark of intelligence, what potentially separates human beings
from earlier life forms, is the ability to think about future
consequences before acting on an impulse. Intelligent activity
involves contemplation of long-range goals, organizing and planning
routes to these goals, and persisting toward one's goals in the face
of short-lived impulses to the contrary. The idea that intelligence
involves impulse control is nicely captured by the term prudence, an
alternative label for the Conscientiousness domain. Prudent means
both wise and cautious.
<br /><br/>
Persons who score high on the
Conscientiousness scale are, in fact, perceived by others as intelligent.
The benefits of high conscientiousness are obvious. Conscientious
individuals avoid trouble and achieve high levels of success through
purposeful planning and persistence. They are also positively
regarded by others as intelligent and reliable. On the negative
side, they can be compulsive perfectionists and workaholics.
Furthermore, extremely conscientious individuals might be regarded
as stuffy and boring.
